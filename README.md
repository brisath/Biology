Chapter 4 of IGCSE Biology typically focuses on **Biological Molecules**, which includes the study of key molecules essential for life. Here's an overview of the important topics covered:

### 1. **Carbohydrates**
   - **Monosaccharides** (e.g., glucose, fructose): Simple sugars, the basic units of carbohydrates.
   - **Disaccharides** (e.g., sucrose, maltose): Formed from two monosaccharide molecules.
   - **Polysaccharides** (e.g., starch, glycogen, cellulose): Long chains of monosaccharides, used for energy storage (starch, glycogen) or structural purposes (cellulose in plant cell walls).

### 2. **Proteins**
   - **Amino acids**: The building blocks of proteins, containing an amino group (–NH2) and a carboxyl group (–COOH).
   - **Protein structure**: 
     - **Primary structure**: Sequence of amino acids.
     - **Secondary and tertiary structures**: Folding of the protein into specific shapes, which are crucial for its function (e.g., enzymes).
   - **Functions of proteins**: Enzymes, structural components, transport molecules (e.g., hemoglobin), antibodies, etc.

### 3. **Lipids (Fats and Oils)**
   - **Triglycerides**: Composed of one glycerol molecule and three fatty acids.
   - **Functions of lipids**: Energy storage, insulation, making up cell membranes (phospholipids), protection of organs.
   - **Saturated vs Unsaturated fats**: Saturated fats have no double bonds between carbon atoms, while unsaturated fats have one or more double bonds.

### 4. **Enzymes**
   - **Enzyme structure**: Proteins that act as biological catalysts.
   - **Function**: Speed up chemical reactions without being consumed.
   - **Enzyme-substrate complex**: The specific interaction between the enzyme's active site and the substrate.
   - **Factors affecting enzyme activity**: Temperature, pH, enzyme concentration, substrate concentration.
   - **Denaturation**: Irreversible change in enzyme structure due to extreme conditions (temperature or pH).

### 5. **Water**
   - Essential for life, acting as a solvent, a medium for chemical reactions, and aiding in temperature regulation in organisms.
   - **Properties of water**: High heat capacity, cohesion and adhesion, excellent solvent for ionic and polar substances.

### 6. **Tests for Biological Molecules**
   - **Benedict's test for reducing sugars**: Turns from blue to brick-red upon heating if reducing sugars are present.
   - **Iodine test for starch**: Turns from yellow-brown to blue-black if starch is present.
   - **Biuret test for proteins**: Turns from blue to purple in the presence of proteins.
   - **Emulsion test for lipids**: A white, cloudy layer indicates the presence of fats or oils.

These concepts are fundamental for understanding how organisms use biological molecules to sustain life. Students are often asked to conduct experiments and interpret data related to these molecules in their IGCSE Biology coursework.# Biology
